- **Spring Boot Integration**: Leverage Spring Boot's powerful features to build a robust GraphQL server.
- **Data Persistence**: Use JPA and Hibernate for data persistence.
- **Validation**: Implement input validation using Spring's validation framework.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.3.5**
